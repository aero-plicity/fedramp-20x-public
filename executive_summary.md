# Executive Summary (Aeroplicity 20x Moderate)

Aeroplicity provides frictionless operating software for Aerospace & Defense. This submission targets FedRAMP 20x Moderate and emphasizes:

- Machine-readable source of truth for KSI validations
- Automated verification with clear human-readable summaries
- Sanitized public artifacts with a defined path to request restricted evidence
- A practical plan to continuously report validation status post-authorization

Security posture highlights
- GovCloud-only deployment and data residency
- Federated identity and least-privilege RBAC/ABAC with time-bound access for sensitive operations
- Centralized logging with integrity protections and export to agency SIEMs
- Continuous validation pipeline to detect drift and degraded configurations

How this package aligns to 20x
- Human-readable narratives: submission_rationale.md, ksis_assessment.md
- Machine-readable results and schema: unified_ksi_validations-public.json, ksi_results_schema.json
- Evidence indexing and access path: evidence_index.json, access_instructions.json
- 3PAO integrated verification: 3pao_attestation.md (signed PDF to be attached)
- Continuous reporting: continuous_monitoring_plan.md, conmon_pipeline.json
