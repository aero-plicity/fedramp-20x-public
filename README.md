# Aeroplicity FedRAMP 20x - Public

> **Purpose.** This repository hosts **public** materials that support Aeroplicityâ€™s FedRAMP 20x authorization effort. It contains no Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI), export-controlled data, or production secrets. Any evidence references point to redacted or synthetic examples intentionally prepared for public release.

## Key Security Indicator (KSI) Control Structure

This repository uses Key Security Indicator (KSI) controls for FedRAMP compliance validation. The KSI controls are defined using a structured JSON format that validates specific NIST SP 800-53 controls through automated checks.

### KSI Structure

Each KSI control follows this structure:

```json
{
  "KSI-IDENTIFIER": {
    "description": "Description of the security requirement being validated",
    "controls": [
      "control-id-1",
      "control-id-2"
    ],
    "scope": "This KSI applies to [specific components/services/systems]",
    "cli_commands": [
      {
        "command": "validation_command",
        "client_type": "aws_service_or_http",
        "explanation": "How this evidence demonstrates compliance"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Command Types

The system supports several types of validation commands:

1. **Evidence Check** - Verifies files exist in the evidence directory
2. **AWS API Calls** - Executes boto3 methods (e.g., `client.describe_instances()`)
3. **HTTP Downloads** - Downloads content from URLs
4. **Multi-step Operations** - Complex validation workflows with post-processing
5. **Aeroplicity API Calls** - Internal API endpoint validation

### KSI Categories

KSI identifiers follow the pattern: `KSI-[CATEGORY]-[NUMBER]`
- **CED**: Configuration and Environment Controls
- **IAM**: Identity and Access Management Controls
- **NET**: Network Security Controls
- **CRY**: Cryptographic Controls
- **AUD**: Audit and Accountability Controls

### Evidence Organization

Evidence files are organized in the `evidence/{KSI-ID}/` directory structure, with automated validation ensuring all required evidence exists for compliance verification.
